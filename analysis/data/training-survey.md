50 - "I have moderate understanding and some practical experience with understanding and using X tools. I feel somewhat confident in understanding and using X tools."
75 - "I have substantial knowledge and experience in understanding and using X tools. I am confident in my ability to understand and use X tools effectively"
100 - "I have expert level knowledge and extensive experience in understanding and using X tools, and I am fully confident in my ability to understand and use X tools."
